# Project Title: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Server  

Repository Details  
This repository contains the implementation of a **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Server** that handles multiple client requests, determines the game outcome, and returns the results. The project is developed using Python for server-side logic, with testing and coverage reporting implemented to ensure code reliability.  

## Task Details  
**Task Description**:  
Implement a Rock-Paper-Scissors game server that receives client inputs, processes the game logic, and returns the outcome (win, lose, or draw). Additionally, a testing framework is implemented to verify the functionality of the server, with reports on test coverage and results.  

**Task Goals**:  
- Create a game server using Python.  
- Implement unit tests using a testing framework (such as "unittest" or "pytest").  
- Generate test coverage reports to ensure code quality.  
- Expand on hardware integration and new features in future tasks.
